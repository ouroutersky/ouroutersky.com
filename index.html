		<h2>ʚɞ Solar System 🪐</h2>
		<p>Our solar system is the neighborhood of our planet, Earth. It is made up of one star (the Sun) and all the objects that orbit around it, such as planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. There are eight planets in our solar system, which are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each planet has its own unique characteristics, such as size, distance from the Sun, and atmosphere. Some planets have moons orbiting around them, like how our Moon orbits around Earth. </p>
            
            <p>The solar system formed about 4.6 billion years ago, when a cloud of gas and dust collapsed under its own gravity. The central part of the cloud became the Sun, while the rest of the material formed a swirling disk around it. Over time, this disk clumped together to form the planets and other objects in our solar system. Studying our solar system can help us learn about the history and evolution of our own planet, as well as the possibilities of life on other planets.</p>

		<h2>ʚɞ ARTEMIS II Moon Mission 🚀</h2>
		<p>The ARTEMIS II Moon Mission is a NASA project to explore the Moon's south pole region, with the aim of preparing for future lunar missions. The mission is scheduled to launch in 2024, and will carry four astronauts on board. These four astronauts will play a critical role in conducting scientific experiments, collecting samples, and testing new technology. The mission is expected to provide important data that will help scientists better understand the Moon's geology, environment, and potential resources.</p> 
            <p>This ambitious mission marks an important step forward in human exploration of space, and the four astronauts who will be a part of it will make history as they venture into the unknown depths of our celestial neighbor. As a school project, learning about the ARTEMIS II mission can be a great way to get interested in space and astronomy, and to explore the fascinating world beyond our planet.</p>

		<h2>ʚɞ Black Hole 🌌</h2>
		<p>A black hole is a place in space where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape it, not even light. It happens when a very big star dies and its core collapses under the weight of its own gravity. When this happens, it becomes a tiny, incredibly dense point called a singularity. Around the singularity, there is an area called the event horizon where gravity is so strong that anything that comes too close gets sucked in. Black holes are invisible because they don't emit any light, but we can detect them by looking at how they affect things around them.</p>
        <p>Black holes come in different sizes. There are small black holes that are only a few times the mass of the Sun, and there are supermassive black holes that can be millions or even billions of times more massive than the Sun. Supermassive black holes are thought to be at the center of most galaxies, including our own Milky Way. While black holes may seem scary, they don't pose any immediate threat to us. Even if the Sun were to be replaced by a black hole of the same mass, we wouldn't get sucked in because we're too far away. However, black holes are still very mysterious and scientists are still trying to learn more about them.</p>

		<h2>ʚɞ Star Constellation 💫</h2>
		<p>Star constellations are groups of stars that are named after mythological creatures, animals, or objects. They form patterns in the sky that people have been using to navigate and tell stories for thousands of years. Some of the most famous constellations are Orion, the Big Dipper, and the Southern Cross. People use constellations as a guide for stargazing, and some cultures believe that they can predict the future based on the movements of the stars.</p>
        <p>There are 88 types of constellations in astronomy, including 13 of the constellations that the sun passes through during the year, but most people are only familiar with the 12 zodiac constellations. These constellations are important in astrology, where people believe that the position of the sun and planets at the time of a person's birth can influence their personality and future. The 13th constellation, Ophiuchus, was left out of the zodiac because the Babylonians wanted to have 12 equal parts for the year. However, Ophiuchus is still recognized by astronomers and stargazers alike.</p>
